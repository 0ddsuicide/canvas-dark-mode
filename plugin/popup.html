<h1>Is Canvas Dark Mode Not Working?</h1>

<h3><i>Canvas is still light mode!</i></h3>
<p>After installing, try refreshing the canvas page.</p>

<h3><i>I refreshed and it's still not working!</i></h3>
<p>Your school's URL might not be in the list that this plugin has.  
    To add your school, send me an email at 
    <strong style="color: rgb(255, 85, 85);">robd@vt.edu</strong> and please include your school's 
    canvas URL. <i>Eg: https://canvas.vt.edu/</i> <br>
    I update this plugin often and will add your school.
</p>

<h3><i>You missed a spot! I see light!</i></h3>
<p>Every canvas page is slightly different and its very likely there are holes.
    Please sent me an email with a screenshot of the spot I missed and I will
    see what I can do to fix it.
</p>

<p>This plugin is also open source, so if you would like to correct something
    that I missed, make a branch and submit a pull request.  
    This is a great and easy way for CS students to contribute to an open source project!

    You can see the repo <a style="color: aquamarine;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DeGrandis/canvas-dark-mode">here.</a>

<h3><i>I am completely satisfied with this dark mode!</i></h3>
<p>Thank you!  That's great to hear.
